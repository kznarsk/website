		<h1>AsciiMind</h1>
		<p><a href="../index.html">Go back to main page</a><br>This is a command-line game based on the classic board game "Mastermind". It differs in that instead of colours it uses ASCII characters. This is nice, because there are more ASCII characters than distinguishable colours. What is also neat is that after every guess you make, you see how many possible answers there are left.</p>

		<h2>Compile it</h2>
		<p>On a UNIX system compiling this program is easy. Make sure you have a c compiler installed and then just run <i>cc ascii_mind.c</i>. On windows it will probably be quite easy as well.<p>
		<h2>Run it</h2>
		<p>On a UNIX system you run it with <i>./a.out [slots] [ascii-characters]</i>. Replace <i>[slots]</i> with the amount of slots you want to have and replace <i>[ascii-characters]</i> with the amount of characters you want to use. On windows it will probably be quite easy as well.
