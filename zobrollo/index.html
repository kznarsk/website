		<h1>Zobrollo</h1>
		<p><a href="../index.html">Go back to main page</a><br>
		Zobrollo is a 2d minimalistic top-view racing game programmed in C using the <a href="https://liballeg.org">Allegro</a> library. At this point of development you can only play in time trial.</p>

		<h2>How to build</h2>
		You will first need to compile the source code. You can get the source code by downloading the zip file or cloning it from <a href="https://github.com/kznarsk/zobrollo">github</a>. You should also make sure you have <a href="https://liballeg.org">Allegro</a> installed. Then go to the directory of the source and run:</p> 
		<i>make</i>
		<p> If everything went well an executable will appear that you can run.
		<h2>How to run</h2>
		<p>On UNIX-like operating systems use:</p>
		<i>./zobrollo</i>
		<p>This should start the game. You should keep the file `zobrollo` in this directory as this is also the place where the tracks and sprites that the program uses are stored.</p>

		<h2>Help!! I don't understand the steps you just described.</h2>
		In this case there is no need to worry. Because I would be more than glad to help you as I probably have too much free time anyway. Just send me an <a href="mailto:thomas.v.maaren@outlook.com">E-mail</a>.

		<h2>To-do list</h2>
		This is a list features that I intend to add in the foreseeable future. I've ordered it in order of when I intend to implement them:
		<ol>
			<li>Be able to view records from a graphical interface.</li>
			<li>Be able to store, replay and race against ghosts from a graphical interface.</li>
			<li>Add more tracks.</li>
			<li>Be able to change controls in config file</li>
			<li>Be able to race against each other on a local network. I already have a working test for this I just haven't properly implemented it yet.</li>
			<li>Be able to race with anyone in the world. For this I will need to write server-side software.</li>
			<li>A settings menu.</li>
		</ol>
