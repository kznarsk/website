		<h1>Zobrollo</h1>
		<p><a href="../index.html">Go back to main page</a><br>
		Zobrollo is a 2d minimalistic top-view racing game programmed in C using the <a href="https://liballeg.org">Allegro</a> library. At this point of development you can only play in time trial. The game also has a record keeping system and you can save a race you have played and race against your older selve.</p>
		<h2>Installation</h2>
		On a Unix based system you will first need to compile the source code. You can get the source code by downloading the zip file or cloning it from my <a href="https://github.com/kznarsk/zobrollo">github</a>. You should also make sure you have <a href="https://liballeg.org">Allegro</a> installed. Then go to the directory of the source and run make. If everything went well an executable will appear that you can run. At the moment I haven't tried compiling for windows, so it will probably not work. This I intend to change in the future.
		<h2>Running the game</h2>
		To play the game you have to specify the track you want to play on. At the moment there are only two tracks <i>Long Straight</i> and <i>example</i>. You can find these files in the directory of the source. On a Unix based system you can run the game by going to the directory of executable and running the comand: <i>./race [OPTIONS] [Track file]</i>. You should replace <i>[Track file]</i> by the path of the track. Then there are some optional flags you can use:<ul>

		<li><i>-r [record file]</i>: Reads and writes records to <i>record file</i></li>
		<li><i>-s [ghost file]</i>: Store the race you are currently playing in <i>ghost file</i>.</li>
		<li><i>-p [ghost file]</i>: Race against the ghost stored in <i>ghost file</i>.</li></ul>

		<h2>Help!! I don't understand the steps you just described.</h2>
		In this case there is no need to worry. Because I would be more than glad to help you as I probably have too much free time anyway. Just send me an <a href="mailto:thomas.v.maaren@outlook.com">E-mail</a>.
		<h2>To-do list</h2>
		This is a list features that I intend to add in the forseeable future. I've ordered it in order of when I intend to implement them:
		<ol>
			<li>Make it possible to start the game in a menu where you can select a track and then play it. Making it easier for normies.</li>
			<li>Windows support.</li>
			<li>Be able to view records from a graphical interface.</li>
			<li>Be able to store, replay and race against ghosts from a graphical interface.</li>
			<li>Add more tracks.</li>
			<li>Be able to race against each other on a local network. I already have a working test for this I just haven't properly implemented it yet.</li>
			<li>Be able to race with anyone in the world. For this I will need to write server-side software.</li>
			<li>A settings menu.</li>
		</ol>
